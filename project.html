              <h2>Personal Website Building Project</h2>
              <p>
                This website that you are currently browsing has been a significant project of mine that has 
                greatly developed my abilities as a web developer. A breakdown of each page and features is as follows:
              </p>
              <br>
              <br></br>
              <h3>The Page Build Script</h3>
              <p>
                Before individual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is applied on each page, the main page-build script runs, and builds the
                navigation, site logo, and page transitions and behaviors. While it was a challenge at first to standardize the build for each
                page, doing so has increased the speed of finishing each page, reduced errors, and provided a cohesive theme for the site. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <br></br>
              <h3>The Home Page</h3>
              <p>
                The home page has a unique splash screen that is displayed the first time that a user visits the site in a session. To prevent the splash screen from
                appearing every time a user navigated to the home page, I had to use session memory to track the first load of the page. While this method has more limitations
                than using a cookie, it was faster to implement, and accomplishes what I need. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The scrolling slideshow on the home page was difficult at first due to the on-demand loading of the images. The first time through the slideshow, there would be jerks
                due to the images loading as they were needed, and before they were locally cached. To circumvent this problem, I wrote a script that loads each image, and then hides them
                while the user is seeing the first-load splash screen. It did cause the load-screen to be present a little longer, but the image transitions on the slideshow were now consistently smooth
                which was a user-experience that I prioritized over a longer load time in this case. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <br></br>
              <h3>The About Page</h3>
              <p>
                The 'About' page was the most-straightforward page of this website to develop. The layout of the bio and the skill boxes had o undergo a few revisions
                until I was happy with the layout, but the content features on this page are fairly vanilla. The one challenge I had was with the skill box expansion with a 
                'click' event. Opening a box was no problem, but I was having difficulties with the 'click' listeners applying to the box content, and trying to re-open the box when
                the user clicked the sub-content. Unfortunately, the best solution I came up with was checking the event targets to ensure it was a valid target before running the rest of the script.
                I imagine there is a more eloquent way to accomplish that solution, and I may look into it more later.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br></br>
              <h3>The Project Page</h3>
              <p>
                 The project page is mainly comprised of a few absolutely-positioned divs that are activated by click events like this one that you are viewing. 
                 Each button is linked to the content page, and uses a bollean based click event to either open or close a page while checking to see if any other
                 open content pages need to be closed. The updates bar simply drops down or rolls up on a click. It also reshapes the content pages to allow them to 
                 exist alongside it in the simulated relative-position. All of this was a personal design-choice, and I think it will have a greater advantage as more 
                 updates and project content are added to the page over time.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br></br>
              <h3>The Contact Page</h3>
              <p>
                 Each of the previous pages is mostly static in nature. This is largely due to this website being part of a 3-week school project with no time for extensive back-end work. 
                 However, the contact page is where I made an exception, and included a small aspect of dynamic functionality. This choice was made because the features that I wanted were not possibile 
                 with static development, and I also thought that some time in back-end would be beneficial. The layout and appearance of the contact page is mostly static, but the conact form itself has 
                 more going on under the hood. The contact form submits via 'post' method to a web-app that I deployed on an outside server. This web-app then takes the information entered by the user,
                 packages it with a node module, and sends it to my personal email via another module. Once the email is sucessfully sent, the server links to a sent-success page that redirects back to the 
                 original form. In summary, the contact page was fairly easy to build on the front-end, but the back-end functionality of the email web-app took a lot of work and learning.
