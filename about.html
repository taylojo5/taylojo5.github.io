          <br></br>
          <p> My name is Jonathan Taylor. I am a student pursuing a B.S. degree in computer science at 
            Oregon State University while I work full-time at Envoy Air Inc. and pursue an intentional,
             laughter-filled life with my wife. 
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> I have always been drawn to solving problems and creating solutions in all parts of my life.
             This enthusiasm has given me great success and satisfaction in my current occupation as an
              Aircraft Technician at Envoy Air Inc. As an aircraft technician, I perform a great deal of 
              troubleshooting and problem solving to fix discrepancies on the aircraft I work with. 
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> My prompting to pursue a different vocation has stemmed from my desire for continual
             development, my love of learning, and a healthy dose of frustration with the reactionary
              nature of fixing aircraft discrepancies caused by design flaws. My desire is to educate
               myself and move to the level of an engineer who designs the systems, prevents the problems,
                and adjusts the architecture of a design to continually improve the system. I have always
                 enjoyed building personal computers, tinkering with Arduino code, and maintaining the
                  aircraft flight computers I work with. Combining all those strengths and interests, I am confident
                  that Computer Science is a field in which I can accel. 
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> My attitude and diligence towards both my current vocation, and my schoolwork are driven 
            by my core values:
            <br></br>
            <ul id="personalValues">
              <li>
                Work to do the best job I can the first time, learn from the failures, and then make each 
                attempt that follows even better.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cultivate a lifestyle of working for excellence, investing in my personal relationships, 
                and recognizing when I mistakenly place my worth in either one. 
              </li>
              <li>
                My attitude towards each task or situation has more of an impact on my response than the 
                circumstances.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> I am still at the stage of constantly amazement at how much software is out there that I do 
            not know yet, and that is where I find the excitement. Even though sometimes I spend hours 
            searching for one misplaced semicolon, the struggle is part of the journey. There is an entire
             world of software development and engineering to be discovered, and I am loving my lifelong
              journey of discovery in it.
