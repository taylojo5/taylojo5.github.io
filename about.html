          <p> My wife will probably write most of this...
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> Here is some bio content here. This is mostly just so that I can get an idea of how it will view
            when it is finished eventually. I will need to change the scrollbar on the this div so that it 
            doesn't look so bad.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> Here is some more content, and thoughts continued. I may also want to give some kind of indication that
            the bio can be scrolled down when the user is at the top, both ways in the middle, and scroll up when 
            they are at the bottom
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p> I'm not entirely sure how I will go about that. Also, I think I should move the skills a little further
            out towards the edge, so that the page feels less claustrophobic. Maybe go back to my original plan of the 
            bio on top and the skills below. Not ideal, but this is crowded. 
          </p>
